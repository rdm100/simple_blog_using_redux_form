Simple blog using redux form.

#I created an app using redux formthat displays simple blog posts as a list of posts in the index, shows individual posts and deletes them

#I used React, Redux, Redux form and Bootstrap. 

#To run the app clone the repository then navigate to the path where it is saved using the console/terminal and type npm install and press enter then type npm start and press enter.

#Then open your browser and enter the URL "http://localhost:8080/" in the address bar.
